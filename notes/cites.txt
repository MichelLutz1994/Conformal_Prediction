“Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.”
― Voltaire 

According to Stanford Uni-
versity Prof. Emmanuel Candes: “Predictive models are used to make decisions that can
have enormous consequences for people’s lives. It’s extremely important to understand
the uncertainty about these predictions, so people don’t make decisions based on false
beliefs” [131].
