confidence 
- who likely is a alternative prediction to the point prediction

credibility
- how likely is the point prediction

1. construct a good heuristic uncertanty estimation (with NN)
	- batch normalisation
	- early stopping
	- dropout (maybe worsesn the effect - see Guo et. all.)
	- penalizing low entropy regularisation
	- label smoothing
	- focal loss
	

p-value ( p(X| H_o = true) 
	in conformal prediction -> H_o hypothesis of randomness: data is IID
	-> lower p-value -> data is more strange with respect to the other datapoints
